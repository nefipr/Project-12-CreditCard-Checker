# Project-12-CreditCard-Checker

Project Goals
Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 

In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, 
but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. 

Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!
